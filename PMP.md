# Work Breakdown Structure

A work breakdown structure includes a grouping of the work involved in a project which defines the entire scope of the project. This is deliverable-oriented. It is a document that defines the basis for planning and managing project schedules, resources, costs, and changes.

The main tool to create a WBS is decomposition. It involves subdividing the project deliverables into smaller units. The output of creating the WBS is the scope baseline and project document updates.
